prompt: |
  You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a transcript from a programming/technical stream that includes discussions on AI coding-related topics. Your goal is to extract key information, classify the stream, identify potential topics for articles and YouTube shorts, and provide a detailed summary.

  Here's the transcript of the stream:

  <transcript>
  {{TRANSCRIPT}}
  </transcript>

  The title of the stream is:

  Please follow these steps to analyze the transcript:

  1. Read through the transcript carefully.

  2. Identify different sections of the stream based on topics discussed. List these sections with their approximate timestamps.

  3. For each step of the analysis, use <thinking_block> tags to show your thought process:

     a. Extract key information:
        - List each main speaker and guest as you encounter them in the transcript, quoting relevant parts
        - Note each primary programming language or technology discussed, with supporting quotes
        - List each specific project or tool mentioned, providing context from the transcript
        - Record any notable quotes or insights shared during the stream (provide direct citations)

     b. Classify the stream:
        - Consider at least three potential primary focuses (e.g., AI development, web programming, data science)
        - List pros and cons for each potential focus
        - Consider at least three potential formats (e.g., tutorial, Q&A, project walkthrough, discussion)
        - List pros and cons for each potential format
        - Determine the best fit for primary focus and format based on your analysis

     c. Generate tags:
        - Brainstorm a list of 15-20 potential tags, each with a brief justification
        - Narrow down the list to 5-10 most relevant tags for easy filing and categorization

     d. Identify potential article topics:
        - List 8-10 topics discussed in the stream that could be expanded into full articles
        - For each topic, provide a brief explanation of why it would make a good article and assign a relevance score (1-10)
        - Select the top 3-5 topics based on relevance scores and provide a detailed explanation of what specific points they could cover

     e. Identify potential YouTube shorts topics:
        - List 8-10 topics from the stream that could be suitable for compact videos
        - For each topic, briefly explain why it would be interesting to a larger audience and assign a relevance score (1-10)
        - Select the top 3-5 topics based on relevance scores and explain in detail what key points they could cover in a short format

     f. Summarize the stream:
        - Write a detailed overview of the stream's content, covering multiple topics if applicable
        - Highlight the main value propositions for viewers

  4. After your analysis, present your findings in the following structured format:

  <results>
    <stream_sections>
      <section>
        <timestamp>[Start time - End time]</timestamp>
        <topic>[Brief description of the topic discussed]</topic>
        <summary>[More detailed overview of the section]</summary>
      </section>
      [Repeat for each section identified]
    </stream_sections>

    <key_information>
      <speakers>[List main speakers and guests]</speakers>
      <technologies>[List primary programming languages and technologies]</technologies>
      <projects_and_tools>[List specific projects and tools mentioned]</projects_and_tools>
      <quotes>
        <quote>
          <text>[Quote text]</text>
          <citation>[Timestamp or context]</citation>
        </quote>
        [Repeat for each notable quote]
      </quotes>
    </key_information>

    <classification>
      <primary_focus>[Your assessment]</primary_focus>
      <format>[Your assessment]</format>
    </classification>

    <tags>
      <tag>[Tag 1]</tag>
      <tag>[Tag 2]</tag>
      [Repeat for each tag]
    </tags>

    <article_topics>
      <topic>
        <title>[Topic 1 title]</title>
        <explanation>[Detailed explanation and potential points to cover]</explanation>
      </topic>
      [Repeat for each article topic]
    </article_topics>

    <youtube_shorts_topics>
      <topic>
        <title>[Topic 1 title]</title>
        <explanation>[Explanation of interest to larger audience and key points]</explanation>
      </topic>
      [Repeat for each YouTube shorts topic]
    </youtube_shorts_topics>

    <summary>
      [Your detailed overview of the stream's content and value]
    </summary>

    <title>
      [Title under which to file the stream]
    </title>
  </results>

  Ensure that your final output includes only the content within the <results> tags. Do not include any additional commentary or notes outside of these tags, and do not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.

  Output your analysis in the <file> tag format:
  <file name="transcript_analysis.xml">
  <!-- Insert the entire <results> XML structure here -->
  </file>

  Include <!-- all files emitted --> on a new line AFTER the last </file> tag.
  If you cannot extract certain information or create a particular file due to missing data, explain the issue within <error> tags.
