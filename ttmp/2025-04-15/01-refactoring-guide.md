Okay, I will create a detailed cleanup plan focusing on file naming and organization for the `recursive` module. This plan will be saved in `ttmp/2025-04-15/01-refactoring-cleanup-guide.md` and is designed for a developer new to this part of the codebase.

This initial phase will *only* involve renaming and moving files/directories. **No code logic will be changed.** As a consequence, Python imports will be broken after completing these steps. Fixing the imports will be a separate, subsequent task.

# Recursive Module: Phase 1 Cleanup Plan (Naming & Organization)

## 1. Introduction

**Goal:** Improve the organization, clarity, and naming consistency of files and directories within the `recursive` Python module.

**Scope:** This initial phase focuses *exclusively* on:
    *   Renaming files and directories for better clarity and consistency (snake_case).
    *   Reorganizing the directory structure for improved modularity.
    *   Consolidating or relocating utility/configuration files.

**Out of Scope (for this phase):**
    *   Changing any Python code logic (functions, classes, methods).
    *   Adding or modifying type hints.
    *   Writing or modifying tests.
    *   Updating docstrings or comments (beyond what's necessary for `__init__.py`).
    *   **Fixing Python imports.** This plan *will* break existing imports. Fixing them is the immediate next step *after* this file reorganization is complete.

**Audience:** This guide is intended for a developer tasked with performing this initial structural refactoring.

**Process:** Follow the steps outlined below sequentially. Use version control (e.g., Git) and commit after each significant step (like completing all renames or finishing a major directory move) to make rollbacks easier if needed.

```

**Observations:**
*   Inconsistent location of base classes (e.g., `agent/agent_base.py` vs `executor/agents/base_agent.py`).
*   Utility-like files at the top level (`cache.py`, `memory.py`, `engine.py`, `graph.py`).
*   Configuration (`api_key.env`) and scripts (`*.sh`) mixed with source code.
*   Multiple `register.py` files.
*   Long/unclear directory names (`story_writing_wo_search_nl_version_english`).
*   Typo in `selector_and_summazier.py`.

## 4. Refactoring Steps (Execute Sequentially)

**Remember to commit changes frequently using git.**

### Step 4.1: Create New Directories

Create the new directories required by the target structure:
*   `recursive/core/`
*   `recursive/config/`
*   `recursive/scripts/`
*   `recursive/agents/regular/`

### Step 4.2: File Renaming (Within Original Locations)

Rename the following files *without* moving them yet:
*   `recursive/agent/agent_base.py` -> `recursive/agent/base.py`
*   `recursive/agent/agents/regular.py` -> `recursive/agent/agents/agent.py`
*   `recursive/executor/agents/base_agent.py` -> `recursive/executor/agents/base.py`
*   `recursive/executor/actions/base_action.py` -> `recursive/executor/actions/base.py`
*   `recursive/executor/actions/action_executor.py` -> `recursive/executor/actions/executor.py`
*   `recursive/executor/actions/builtin_actions.py` -> `recursive/executor/actions/builtin.py`
*   `recursive/executor/actions/register.py` -> `recursive/executor/actions/registry.py`
*   `recursive/executor/actions/selector_and_summazier.py` -> `recursive/executor/actions/selector_summarizer.py`
*   `recursive/llm/llm.py` -> `recursive/llm/client.py`
*   `recursive/utils/get_index.py` -> `recursive/utils/indexing.py`
*   `recursive/utils/register.py` -> `recursive/utils/registry.py`
*   `recursive/agent/prompts/story_writing_wo_search_nl_version_english/write_planning.py` -> `recursive/agent/prompts/story_writing_wo_search_nl_version_english/planning.py`
*   `recursive/agent/prompts/story_writing_wo_search_nl_version_english/write_combine_atom_and_update.py` -> `recursive/agent/prompts/story_writing_wo_search_nl_version_english/updater.py`
*   `recursive/agent/prompts/report/write_combine_atom_and_update.py` -> `recursive/agent/prompts/report/updater.py`
    *   *(Note: Further consolidation of report prompt files like `write_planning.py`/`full_planning.py` and search-related files into `planning.py` and `search.py` respectively involves code changes and is deferred)*. For now, just rename `write_planning.py` -> `planning.py` and `search_combine_atom_update_and_planning.py` -> `search.py` in `recursive/agent/prompts/report/`. Delete the other files (`full_planning.py`, `search_only_update.py`, `merge_search_result.py`) - their functionality will be merged later.

*(Commit changes after renaming)*

### Step 4.3: Directory Renaming

Rename the following directories:
*   `recursive/agent/prompts/story_writing_wo_search_nl_version_english/` -> `recursive/agent/prompts/story_writing/`

*(Commit changes after renaming)*

### Step 4.4: Move Files and Directories

Move the following files/directories to their new target locations:
*   `recursive/engine.py` -> `recursive/core/engine.py`
*   `recursive/graph.py` -> `recursive/core/graph.py`
*   `recursive/memory.py` -> `recursive/core/memory.py`
*   `recursive/cache.py` -> `recursive/utils/cache.py`
*   `recursive/api_key.env` -> `recursive/config/api_key.env`
*   `recursive/api_key.env.example` -> `recursive/config/api_key.env.example`
*   `recursive/test_run_report.sh` -> `recursive/scripts/test_run_report.sh`
*   `recursive/test_run_story.sh` -> `recursive/scripts/test_run_story.sh`
*   `recursive/agent/agents/agent.py` -> `recursive/agents/regular/agent.py` (Move the file into the newly created directory)
*   Delete the now empty `recursive/agent/agents/` directory.
*   Add an empty `recursive/config/__init__.py` file.

*(Commit changes after moving)*

## 5. Verification

*   Use commands like `tree recursive` or `ls -R recursive` to compare the resulting structure against the "Proposed Target Structure" in section 3.
*   Visually inspect the directory contents to ensure all files are in their correct new locations.

## 6. Next Steps

**CRITICAL:** The codebase is now in a broken state due to incorrect imports. The immediate next step is to go through all `.py` files within the `recursive` module and update the `import` statements to reflect the new file locations and names. This is **Phase 2** of the cleanup.
