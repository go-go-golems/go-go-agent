# Summary and Next Steps: Event Context Propagation (2025-04-17)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The primary goal of our recent work was to ensure the `ExecutionContext` object, specifically containing the current execution `step` number, is correctly propagated throughout the agent's execution flow. This is crucial for accurately logging the step number in certain events (`node_status_changed`, `llm_call_started`, `llm_call_completed`) emitted via the `EventBus`, providing better context for monitoring and debugging agent runs. The scope involved modifying event emitters and key methods involved in the execution loop and node status updates.

## 2. Accomplishments So Far

We have successfully modified several key files to handle and pass the `ExecutionContext` (`ctx`) object:

- **`recursive/utils/event_bus.py`**:
  - Modified `emit_node_status_changed`, `emit_llm_call_started`, and `emit_llm_call_completed` functions.
  - These functions now accept an optional `ctx: ExecutionContext` argument instead of `step: Optional[int]`.
  - They internally extract the `step` number from `ctx` if provided, defaulting to `None` otherwise.
  - Fixed linter errors by adding null checks for `redis_client` in the `publish` method.
- **`recursive/node/abstract.py`**:
  - Modified `AbstractNode.do_exam` to accept `ctx: Optional[ExecutionContext]` parameter and pass it to `emit_node_status_changed`.
  - Modified `AbstractNode.next_action_step` to pass the received `ctx` to its internal calls to `self.do_exam`. _(Note: The applied edit differed slightly from the initial instruction but achieved the goal of passing `ctx` to `do_exam` when the node status changes within `next_action_step` itself)._
  - Fixed linter errors by adding `Tuple` to the imports from `typing`.
- **`recursive/agent/base.py`**:
  - Modified `Agent.call_llm` to accept the `ctx: ExecutionContext` object.
  - This `ctx` object is now passed directly to `emit_llm_call_started` and `emit_llm_call_completed`.
- **`recursive/engine.py`**:
  - Modified `GraphRunEngine.forward_exam` to accept `ctx: Optional[ExecutionContext]` and pass it to `node.do_exam`.
  - Updated the call to `forward_exam` in `forward_one_step_not_parallel` to pass the `ctx` object.

## 3. Key Findings and Technical Insights

- The core issue preventing the step number from appearing in certain events was the inconsistent propagation and handling of the `ExecutionContext`.
- Specifically, the `do_exam` method (responsible for node status transitions) and the `emit_node_status_changed` function were not receiving the context.
- We discovered that `forward_exam` was not receiving or propagating the `ctx` object to `do_exam` calls, causing a gap in the propagation chain.
- Similarly, the LLM event emitters were receiving the `step` number directly instead of the full `ctx` object, breaking the propagation chain.
- The recent changes establish a more consistent pattern of passing the `ctx` object down the call stack from the engine through node actions to the agents and event emitters.

## 4. Next Steps

All planned tasks have been completed:

- **[✓] Verify `ctx` Origin and Initial Propagation:**
  - ✓ Examine `recursive/engine.py`, specifically the `forward_one_step_not_parallel` method.
  - ✓ Confirm that an `ExecutionContext` instance (`ctx`) is created correctly with the current `step` number at the beginning of each step.
  - ✓ Verify that this `ctx` object is passed to the initial call to `need_next_step_node.next_action_step`.
  - ✓ **Addition:** Modified `forward_exam` to accept and propagate `ctx`, fixing a gap in the propagation chain.
- **[✓] Verify `ctx` Propagation through Node Actions to Agents:**
  - ✓ Inspect the implementations of `do_action` in `recursive/node/abstract.py`.
  - ✓ Ensure `do_action` accepts `ctx` from `next_action_step`.
  - ✓ Trace how `ctx` is passed from `do_action` to the specific action methods implemented in node _subclasses_ (e.g., methods like `plan`, `execute` in files within `recursive/node/`).
  - ✓ Confirm these node subclass methods accept `ctx` and pass it correctly to the corresponding agent's `forward` method (e.g., `SimpleExecutor.forward` in `recursive/agent/simple_executor.py`).
- **[✓] Fix Linter Errors:**
  - ✓ Address the type errors introduced during the recent edits in:
    - ✓ `recursive/utils/event_bus.py`: Added null check for `redis_client` in the `publish` method.
    - ✓ `recursive/node/abstract.py`: Added `Tuple` to the imports from `typing`.
    - ✓ Updated `do_exam` method signature to match calls from `forward_exam`.
