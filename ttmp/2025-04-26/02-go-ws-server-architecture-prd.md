# Go WebSocket Server Architecture PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the Go implementation of the Recursive Agent Event Logging WebSocket server. The goal is to create a high-performance, robust, and maintainable server that acts as a complete drop-in replacement for the existing Python implementation, adhering to the specifications defined in `01-ws-server-in-depth.md`.

## 2. Goals

- **Performance:** Leverage Go's concurrency model for efficient handling of Redis streams, WebSocket connections, and database operations.
- **Reliability:** Implement robust error handling, automatic reconnection (for Redis), and graceful shutdown.
- **Maintainability:** Utilize clear package structure, idiomatic Go practices, and structured logging.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure 100% compatibility with the existing database schema, API endpoints, WebSocket communication protocol, and configuration methods.
- **Observability:** Integrate structured logging (zerolog) for easier monitoring and debugging.
- **Decoupling:** Use Watermill as a message router to decouple event processing components.

## 3. Overall Architecture

The Go server will be a standalone application consisting of several key concurrent components managed via `context` and `errgroup`, utilizing Watermill for message routing:

        B -- Broadcasts Events --> C
    end

    E <-- PubSub Subscriber --- W
    J <-- Accessed By --- H
```

**Key Components:**

- **Main Application (`cmd/server/main.go`):** ✅ Parses configuration (using Cobra), initializes components (DB, State Managers, HTTP Server, Redis Router), sets up `context` and `errgroup` for lifecycle management, starts and waits for the HTTP server and Watermill router goroutines.
- **HTTP Server (`internal/server/http.go`):** ✅ Uses the standard `net/http` library, `gorilla/mux` for routing, and `gorilla/websocket` for upgrades. Manages its own lifecycle via `errgroup` passed from `main`. Handles:
    - Serving static React UI files (with SPA fallback).
    - Routing HTTP API requests (`/api/*`) to handlers that interact with state managers.
    - Upgrading `/ws/events` connections to WebSocket.
    - Manages the `WSHub` lifecycle.
- **WebSocket Hub (`internal/server/ws.go`):** ✅ Manages active WebSocket client connections (`Client` struct) and runs within the HTTP server's `errgroup`. Responsible for:
    - Registering/unregistering clients via channels.
    - Broadcasting event JSON payloads received via `HTTPServer.BroadcastEvent` to connected clients.
    - Handling client-specific logic (like sending historical data upon connection if `reload_session=true`).
    - Managing client read/write pumps.
    - Graceful shutdown via context cancellation.
- **Watermill Message Router (`internal/redis/router.go`):** ✅ Manages the event flow using Watermill. Runs within the main application's `errgroup`.
    - Configures the Redis Stream PubSub subscriber using `CustomEventUnmarshaller`.
    - Registers a single handler (`messageHandler` in `main.go`) responsible for:
        - Persisting the event via `DatabaseManager`.
        - Updating `EventManager` and `GraphManager`.
        - Broadcasting the raw event JSON via `HTTPServer`.
    - Provides message delivery guarantees (at-least-once) with acknowledgement/retry capabilities.
    - Handles graceful shutdown via context cancellation.
- **Database Manager (`internal/db/manager.go`):** ✅ Handles all interactions with the SQLite database. Responsible for:
    - Establishing and managing the DB connection (including WAL mode).
    - Ensuring the schema exists on startup (`schema.sql` embedded).
    - Storing incoming events (`HandleMessage` method called by the main handler) and updating related tables (`runs`, `nodes`, `edges`, `graph_plans`) within a transaction.
    - Providing methods to query historical data (`GetLatestRunGraph`, `GetLatestRunEvents`).
    - Uses Go's `database/sql` package with `mattn/go-sqlite3`.
- **State Managers (`internal/state/event_manager.go`, `internal/state/graph_manager.go`):** ✅ Maintain in-memory state mirroring the Python implementation. Responsible for:
    - Storing recent events (`EventManager`) and the current graph structure (`GraphManager`).
    - Providing thread-safe methods (using `sync.RWMutex`) to add/update/query state.
    - Loading initial state from the Database Manager via `LoadStateFromDB` methods if `reload_session` is enabled in `main.go`.
    - Processing events via `ProcessEvent` in `GraphManager`.
- **API Handlers (within `internal/server/http.go`):** ✅ Implement the logic for the HTTP API endpoints (`/api/*`), interacting with the `EventManager` and `GraphManager`.
- **Configuration (within `cmd/server/main.go`):** ✅ Uses Cobra flags to define and parse configuration for all components (Redis, DB, HTTP, State, Logging). Default values provided.
- **Logging (within `cmd/server/main.go` and components):** ✅ Centralized setup for structured logging using `zerolog`. Logger instances are passed to components. Watermill uses a `zerolog` adapter.

## 4. Data Flow (Event Processing with Watermill)

1.  **Agent:** An event occurs in the external agent process.
2.  **Event Bus (Python):** The Python `EventBus` publishes the **entire event object serialized as a JSON string** under the key **`json_payload`** within the Redis stream message.
3.  **Watermill Router (Go):** 
    - The Redis Stream PubSub subscribes to the stream and receives new messages.
    - **The implemented `CustomEventUnmarshaller`** reads the `json_payload` field from the Redis message, extracts the JSON string, and constructs a Watermill message with this string as its payload.
    - The message router delivers the message to all registered handlers in parallel.
4.  **Handler Execution:**
    - **Database Handler:** Decodes the JSON payload (which represents the full event), persists the event to SQLite, and acknowledges the message.
    - **State Update Handler:** Decodes the JSON payload, updates in-memory state managers based on the event type/data, and acknowledges the message.
    - **WebSocket Broadcast Handler:** Gets the raw JSON payload, sends it to the WebSocket hub for broadcasting, and acknowledges the message.
5.  **WebSocket Hub:** Takes the raw JSON string from the broadcast handler and sends it to all connected clients.
6.  **UI:** The React UI receives the event JSON string, parses it, and updates its Redux store.

The key advantage is that each handler operates independently on the same original message, with its own acknowledgement control, eliminating the need for custom fan-out channels.

## 5. API Design

The Go server implements the exact same API endpoints as the Python server:

- **WebSocket:**
    - `GET /ws/events`: Handles WebSocket connection upgrades. Sends historical data if `reload_session=true`, then streams live events.
- **HTTP:**
    - `GET /api/events`: Returns JSON `{ "status": "Connected", "events": [...] }` from `EventManager`.
    - `GET /api/graph`: Returns JSON `{ "graph": { "nodes": ..., "edges": ... } }` from `GraphManager`.
    - `GET /api/graph/nodes`: Returns JSON `{ "nodes": { "node_id": {...}, ...} }` from `GraphManager`.
    - `GET /api/graph/nodes/{id}`: Returns JSON node object or 404 from `GraphManager`.
    - `GET /api/graph/edges`: Returns JSON `{ "edges": { "edge_id": {...}, ...} }` from `GraphManager`.
    - `GET /api/graph/edges/{id}`: Returns JSON edge object or 404 from `GraphManager`.
    - `GET /{full_path:path}`: Serves static files from the configured React build directory. If a file isn't found, serves `index.html`.

## 6. Database Interaction

- The `DatabaseManager` will encapsulate all SQLite operations.
- It will use the `database/sql` package and `mattn/go-sqlite3` (or similar CGO-enabled driver).
- Connection management: A single connection pool managed by the `DatabaseManager`.
- Schema Initialization: On startup, `_ensure_db` logic will be replicated to create tables and indexes if they don't exist. The schema is defined in `internal/db/schema.sql` and embedded into the binary using `//go:embed`.
- Event Storage: The `StoreEvent` logic will be used in the Watermill handler function, handling the conditional logic based on `event_type` to update related tables.
- Data Retrieval: Methods like `GetLatestRunEvents` and `GetLatestRunGraph` will be implemented to fetch data for state reloading.
- Transactions: Use transactions where appropriate, especially when multiple tables are updated.
- Error Handling: Database errors will trigger message NACK in the Watermill handler, allowing built-in retry mechanisms to handle temporary failures.

The schema is defined in `internal/db/schema.sql` and embedded into the binary using `//go:embed`.

Additionally, `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` and `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` should be enabled on the connection.

## 7. Configuration Handling

- ✅ Configuration is handled via Cobra flags in `cmd/server/main.go`, providing overrides for environment variables or defaults.
- ✅ All specified options (Redis, DB, HTTP, State, Logging) are configurable via flags.
- 🚫 Viper is not currently used, Cobra flags suffice.

## 8. State Management

- `EventManager` and `GraphManager` structs will reside in the `internal/state` package.
- They will hold the application's in-memory state (event list, nodes/edges maps).
- Data structures will mirror the Python implementation (e.g., using maps for `entities` and slices for `ids`).
- **Concurrency:** All methods that modify or read the internal state must be protected by `sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex` to prevent race conditions, as they will be accessed concurrently by the Watermill handler (writes) and API Handlers (reads).
- State Reloading: On startup (if `reload_session=true`), the main application will call methods on the `DatabaseManager` to get historical data and then pass this data to `LoadStateFromDB` methods on the state managers.

## 9. Concurrency Model

- **`errgroup`:** ✅ The main application (`cmd/server/main.go`) uses `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup` to manage the lifecycle of the primary goroutines (HTTP Server including WebSocket Hub, Watermill Router).
- **Goroutines:** ✅ Managed by `errgroup` in `main.go` and `internal/server/http.go`.
    - HTTP Server listener (`srv.ListenAndServe`)
    - HTTP Server graceful shutdown handler (triggered by context cancellation)
    - Watermill Router (`router.Run`)
    - WebSocket Hub (`hub.Run`) (managed within HTTP server's `errgroup`)
    - WebSocket client read/write pumps (one pair per client, managed by the hub/client itself)
- **Watermill Router:** ✅ A single message handler in `main.go` coordinates DB persistence, state updates, and WebSocket broadcasting for each incoming message. Watermill handles message delivery, acknowledgement, and retries internally.
- **`sync.Mutex` / `sync.RWMutex`:** ✅ Used within `EventManager`, `GraphManager`, and `WSHub` to protect shared data structures.
- **`context.Context`:** ✅ Passed down from the main application (`main.go`) to manage cancellation and timeouts. Signal handling cancels the root context, which propagates through the `errgroup` to the HTTP server, WebSocket Hub, and Watermill router, ensuring graceful shutdown.

## 10. Error Handling

- **Structured Logging:** All errors will be logged using `zerolog` with relevant context (component, function, error details).
- **Watermill Error Handling:**
    - Handlers return errors to indicate message handling status (nil for success, error for failure).
    - Failed messages can be retried with customizable policies.
    - Dead-letter queues can be configured for messages that repeatedly fail.
- **`errgroup`:** Errors returned by the main component goroutines will cause the `errgroup`'s context to be canceled, initiating a graceful shutdown.
- **Component-Level:**
    - **Database Handler:** Return error for NACK, leading to retry. Use transactions and commit/rollback appropriately.
    - **WebSocket Hub:** Handle client connection errors by unregistering the client. Log broadcast errors.
    - **HTTP Server:** Standard HTTP error responses (e.g., 404, 500) with logged details.
- **Error Wrapping:** Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` or `github.com/pkg/errors` for wrapping errors to preserve context.

## 11. Event Message Format and Processing

### Redis Stream Message Format

The Redis Stream messages published by the Python `EventBus` have a specific format that requires special handling in the Go service. Based on examination of actual messages, the Python publisher uses the following pattern:

```
XADD agent_events * json_payload "{ complete JSON serialized event object }"
```

The key aspects of this format are:

- **Single Field:** Unlike Watermill's default publisher which uses multiple fields for message metadata (`_watermill_message_uuid`, `_watermill_payload`), the Python implementation uses a single field `json_payload`.
- **Complete Event Object:** The value of `json_payload` is a JSON string representing the entire event object, including `event_id`, `timestamp`, `event_type`, `payload`, and `run_id`.
- **No Watermill Metadata:** The messages do not contain any Watermill-specific metadata that the default unmarshaller expects.

Example payload structure:
```json
{
  "event_id": "9ec55edc-1f96-4541-8eb7-9382e00a4d7c",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-26T02:56:10.937611Z",
  "event_type": "tool_invoked",
  "payload": {
    "tool_call_id": "8f6a60d4-77a7-48c6-8b60-b71648849794",
    "tool_name": "BingBrowser",
    // other tool-specific fields...
  },
  "run_id": "b3a7ae44-23c4-4082-8ad5-ce1f898a8d27"
}
```

### Custom Unmarshaller Implementation

To handle this Redis message format, a custom unmarshaller has been implemented in `internal/redis/unmarshaller.go`:

```go
package redis

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill"
	"github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill/message"
	"github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
)

// CustomEventUnmarshaller handles the specific format of messages published
// by the Python EventBus, where the entire event is a JSON string under the "json_payload" key
type CustomEventUnmarshaller struct{}

// Unmarshal extracts the event JSON from the Redis stream message
func (u CustomEventUnmarshaller) Unmarshal(values map[string]interface{}) (*message.Message, error) {
	// Get the raw payload value
	payload, ok := values["json_payload"]
	if !ok {
		// Fallback to the default Watermill field, just in case
		payload, ok = values["_watermill_payload"]
		if !ok {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("message does not contain payload under key 'json_payload' or '_watermill_payload'")
		}
	}

	// Handle different payload types
	var payloadStr string
	switch v := payload.(type) {
	case string:
		payloadStr = v
	case []byte:
		payloadStr = string(v)
	default:
		// Marshal any non-string payload to JSON
		b, err := json.Marshal(v)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to marshal payload to JSON string: %w", err)
		}
		payloadStr = string(b)
	}

	// Create a new Watermill message with the payload
	msgUUID := watermill.NewUUID()
	msg := message.NewMessage(msgUUID, []byte(payloadStr))
	return msg, nil
}

// Marshal implements the RedisStreamMarshaller interface, but is not used
// when the component is a subscriber only
func (u CustomEventUnmarshaller) Marshal(topic string, msg *message.Message) (*redis.XAddArgs, error) {
	// This method is not needed for a subscriber-only implementation
	// However, we provide a basic implementation in case it's used for publishing
	return &redis.XAddArgs{
		Stream: topic,
		Values: map[string]interface{}{
			"json_payload": string(msg.Payload),
		},
	}, nil
}
```

This custom unmarshaller is used when configuring the Redis Stream subscriber in `internal/redis/router.go`:

```go
subscriber, err := redisstream.NewSubscriber(
    redisstream.SubscriberConfig{
        Client:          redisClient,
        Unmarshaller:    CustomEventUnmarshaller{},
        ConsumerGroup:   config.ConsumerGroup,
        Consumer:        config.ConsumerName, // Note: Field is Consumer
        BlockTime:       config.BlockTime,
        MaxIdleTime:     config.MaxIdleTime,
        NackResendSleep: config.NackResendSleep,
    },
    watermillLogger,
)
```

### Event Structs and Type Handling

To parse the JSON payloads into Go objects, a set of structs has been defined in the `pkg/model/event.go` package:

1. **Message Reception:** The Watermill Redis Stream subscriber consumes messages from the Redis stream and monitors them for acknowledgement (via XACK).

2. **Message Unmarshalling:** The custom unmarshaller converts the Redis stream item into a Watermill message:
   - Extracts the JSON string from the `json_payload` field
   - Creates a new Watermill message with a generated UUID
   - Sets the full event JSON as the message payload

3. **Router Handling:** The Watermill router delivers the message to all registered handlers:
   - **Database Handler:**
     - Parses the JSON payload back into a Go struct representing the event
     - Determines the event type (`event_type` field) and executes specific logic based on it
     - Updates the appropriate database tables using transactions where necessary
   
   - **State Manager Handler:**
     - Parses the JSON payload into an event object
     - Updates the corresponding state manager (`EventManager` or `GraphManager`) based on event type
     - For graph-relevant events (e.g., `node_created`, `edge_added`), updates the graph structure
     - For event log events, appends to the in-memory event list

   - **WebSocket Broadcast Handler:**
     - Takes the raw message payload (which is already the full JSON event string)
     - Passes it directly to the WebSocket hub
     - The hub forwards it to all connected clients without modification

4. **Message Acknowledgement:** Each handler acknowledges the message upon successful processing using `msg.Ack()` or returns an error which causes Watermill to NACK the message.

### Event Structs and Type Handling

To parse the JSON payloads into Go objects, a set of structs will be defined in the `pkg/model` package:

```go
// Base Event struct matching the Python implementation
type Event struct {
    EventID   string          `json:"event_id"`
    Timestamp string          `json:"timestamp"`
    EventType string          `json:"event_type"`
    Payload   json.RawMessage `json:"payload"` // Use RawMessage for flexible payload types
    RunID     string          `json:"run_id"`
}

// EventType constants
const (
	EventTypeRunStarted          = "run_started"
	EventTypeRunFinished         = "run_finished"
    // ... other constants ...
	EventTypeNodeResultAvailable = "node_result_available"
)

// EventPayload is an interface for event-specific payload types
type EventPayload interface {
	GetType() string
}

// Concrete payload types for each event type
// e.g., RunStartedPayload, NodeCreatedPayload, etc.

// ... payload struct definitions from pkg/model/event.go ...

type RunStartedPayload struct {
	InputData    json.RawMessage `json:"input_data"`
	Config       json.RawMessage `json:"config"`
	RunMode      string          `json:"run_mode"`
	TimestampUTC string          `json:"timestamp_utc"`
}

// ... other payload structs ...

```

The `StateManager` and `DatabaseManager` implementations use these structs to process events and update the in-memory state and database respectively.

## 12. Logging

- Use `github.com/rs/zerolog` for structured JSON logging.
- Initialize the logger in the main application based on the `log_level` config.
- Pass logger instances down to components or use a package-level logger.
- Include contextual fields in logs (e.g., `component`, `run_id`, `event_id`, `client_addr`).
- Configure Watermill to use the implemented structured logging adapter (`WatermillLogger` in `internal/redis/router.go`) for zerolog.

## 13. Dependencies

Based on the implemented code and proposed architecture:

- **`database/sql`:** Standard library for DB interaction.
- **`embed`:** Standard library for embedding schema file.
- **`github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill`:** Message routing framework.
- **`github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-redisstream`:** Redis Stream adapter for Watermill.
- **`github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`:** Underlying Redis client used by the Watermill adapter.
- **`github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`:** CGO driver for SQLite.
- **`github.com/gorilla/websocket`:** WebSocket protocol implementation.
- **`github.com/google/uuid`:** For generating UUIDs if needed.
- **`github.com/rs/zerolog`:** Structured logging.
- **`golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`:** Goroutine lifecycle management (via `golang.org/x/sync`).
- **`github.com/pkg/errors`:** Error wrapping.
- ✅ **`github.com/spf13/cobra`:** CLI framework - now implemented.
- ✅ **`github.com/spf13/viper`:** Configuration management - partially implemented.

## 14. Lifecycle Management

- The main application entry point (`cmd/server/main.go`) will create a root `context`.
- Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM) will be used to cancel this root context.
- The Watermill router will be configured to respect this context via `router.Run(ctx)`.
- Components (Router, Hub, HTTP server shutdown) will listen for context cancellation (`<-ctx.Done()`) to initiate graceful shutdown procedures.
- Watermill will handle draining in-flight messages and proper acknowledgement during shutdown.

## 15. Package Layout

The go module is within `github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-agent/`.

✅ Implemented mostly as proposed. `internal/api` handlers are currently within `internal/server/http.go`. `internal/ws` hub is within `internal/server/ws.go`. `pkg/config` and `pkg/log` were integrated into `cmd/server/main.go`.
